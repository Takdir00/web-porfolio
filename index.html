            <p>They did't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.Its main function serves to clarify what is expected of the deliverables, as well as the communication strategy with which it should be aligned. And just as importantly, you must clarify what is not to be expected. It’s possible that some features that the client wanted are just not realistic within the required timeframe.</p>
